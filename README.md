# UnityBasicShaderEffects
A collection of shaders and scripts that I created for fun. You are free to use these shaders in a commercial capacity, but I cannot guarantee the same for the image/texture assets that I found on the web, so please use your own images/textures. I created these effects using Unity 2019.2.12f1.
